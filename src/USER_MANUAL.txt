Here is how to use the gig scheduler!

To begin, there are four options, and to choose them you have to enter a number:

	1) view the help menu
		- this takes you to this page ;)
	2) add a new gig
		- in this portion, you will be asked for a lot of information about the gig you are wanting to create
		- if you aren't going to sell tickets on a website, you do not have to include one
		- make sure you input information in the requested formats
		- if you enter a band to your gig that doesn't already exists in your table, you will have to enter the information for the new one
			- the website link for the band is optional
			- the image link for the band is optional
	3) view the schedule
		- you can enter a start date, end date, one, or neither and we will display to you all of the gigs within that time span
		- again, be sure to input the information in the requested formats
	4) quit the program
		- this stops the program from running and displays a good by message
